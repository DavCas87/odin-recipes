      <h3>Steps for the Chicken:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="steps-list"></div>
      <ol>
        <li>Grab the chicken breasts, clean them off, and slice them lengthwise so you have two thinner pieces. Then slice them vertically into strips.</li>
        <li>In one large plate or dish, mix together the flour, paprika, garlic powder, salt and cayenne powder. In another plate or dish add the breadcrumbs. In a seperate bowl add the eggs and whip them.</li>
        <li>Take a strip of chicken and powder it with the flour. Once it's all white, shake the excess flour off and dip it into the bowl with the egg. After emersing it in the egg, roll that chicken strip in the breadcrumbs and make sure it's fully breaded. Do this for the rest of the strips.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium/high heat. Use enough oil to cover at least half of the chicken and make sure not to over crowd the pan. Place the chicken in the pan. Make sure the chicken's internal temperature reaches 165Â°F then set aside.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>For the Pasta and Sauce:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="steps-list">
      <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water. Salt the water to your liking. Once you get the water boiling follow the instructions on the package for the desired consistency of your pasta. (I like mine Al Dente!)</li>
        <li>In the same skillet you used for the chicken or in another, add a tbsp of olive oil and cook the garlic until flagrant.</li>
        <li>Once the garlic is flagrant, add the chicken stock, heavy cream, cajun seasoning and parmesan cheese. Whisk together until it starts bubbling. Add some salt and pepper to taste. Once your sauce thickens turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>You can either add the pasta to your sauce or spoon the sauce onto your pasta on a plate, your choice.</li>
        <li>Take the cherry tomatoes and cut them in 4's to garnish your plate. Add your chicken and more Parmesan cheese and enjoy!</li>
