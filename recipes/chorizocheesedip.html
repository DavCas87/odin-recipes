        <ol>
            <li>Cook your chorizo in a large cast iron pan over medium heat breaking up the chorizo and stirring occassionally. Cook until it's browned and lightly crisp. Set aside. Drain if there is excess fat from the chorizo.</li>
            <li>In the same pan you cooked the chorizo heat the olive oil over medium heat then add the garlic and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion becomes translucent.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the flour until lightly brown.</li>
            <li>Gradually stir in half and half. Stirring consistently.</li>
            <li>Once the half and half starts bubbling, reduce the heat, and start adding the cheeses a little at a time. Add until all the cheese is incorporated and the sauce turns smooth. Stir in 1/2 the chorizo and 1/2 the cilantro, season with salt and pepper to taste then remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with tortillas and garnish with the optional toppings if desired.</li>
